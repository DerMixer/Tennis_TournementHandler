In the news article “the celtic tiger” published in the year 2000 by “CBS News” the author Bob Simon briefly informs the reader about Ireland's economic history, the evolution of their industries and the current economic state. The article also features exact numbers about the historical emigration and the current immigration of locals from all sorts of countries back to Ireland due rising the economy, comparatively low taxes and an overall great educational state. 
Following this introduction, the text focuses on individuals like Martin and Connie O’Brien, who left New York to return to Ireland in response to the economic boom. Another key example is Paul McBride, who moved back from Seattle to start a major software testing operation in his home village, highlighting the influence of global companies like Microsoft.
The author attributes Ireland’s success to a combination of factors: a strong education system, low corporate taxes, and the advantage of an English-speaking population. He supports this with concrete examples like Intel’s $5 billion plant and Dell’s operations in Limerick, showing how foreign investment transformed sleepy towns into tech hubs.
The narrative includes reflections from historians and former emigrants, such as Tom Garvin and Conor O’Kelly, who recall the bleakness of Ireland’s past and the pride in its current achievements. These personal accounts underscore the emotional journey from a country once plagued by famine and mass emigration to one now experiencing a reversal: people returning home and Ireland importing labor.
The article also explores the social changes that accompanied economic growth. Symbols of wealth like BMWs, changing gender roles, and a shift from religious to consumer culture all mark the “New Ireland.” Church attendance is down, while shopping malls thrive, and traditionally taboo subjects like divorce and contraception are now accepted. Even attitudes have shifted—from modesty and eccentricity to confidence and punctuality.
Despite these gains, the author notes modern challenges such as stress, traffic, and loss of cultural identity. Yet overall, the tone remains one of optimism, culminating in a sense of national pride as Ireland reclaims its place among the prosperous nations of the world.
